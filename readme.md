## **LI: Solving complex problems using Prolog and PicoSat**

---

In this project several problems are solved using Prolog and PicoSat. There are NP problems such as Travelling Sales Man (TSP) or creating a time table for a competition.

In order to compile an specific problem, you need to take erase the # before the name and run the following command :  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`make`

To run the problem, we just do the following:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`./tsp`
